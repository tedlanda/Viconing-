### Viconing

**Introduction**

Conducted a user study of a motion capture technology and created a museum gallery where research findings are displayed. The user can navigate around and click on bulletin boards in order to learn more about Vicon, a motion tracking and movement sensing camera system. As soon as the application is loaded, the user is instantly in a a scene filled with tall billboards, a picnic table and some writing on a wall. The writing on the wall is the guide to play the game and the contains directions on how to interact with the museum.  

**Development Process**

The GVR Unity SDK version used for this project was 1.0.3.

__Conclusion__

What I liked
The ability to start the project from scratch whereas before, some templates were given as a starter and we had to download them into our Unity scenes. I was able to kill two birds with one stone by learning more about a technology which for one, I need to know more about for my full time job and two, a requirement for this project.

What I disliked
Having to troubleshoot a lot of small issues and fix compiler errors in the matter of days. This took time away from actually working on the project and a lot of mentoring and forum searching had to be done in order to complete the project.
