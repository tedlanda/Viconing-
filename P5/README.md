### Viconing

**Introduction**

Conducted a user study of a motion capture technology and created a museum gallery where research findings are displayed. The user can navigate around and click on bulletin boards in order to learn more about Vicon, a motion tracking and movement sensing camera system. As soon as the application is loaded, the user is instantly in a a scene filled with tall billboards, a picnic table and some writing on a wall. The writing on the wall is the guide to play the game and the contains directions on how to interact with the museum.  

**Development Process**

The GVR Unity SDK version used for this project was 1.0.3.
Firstly, the perimeter of the museum gallery was built with scaled game objects. Then, some ideas came to mind on how to display images on billboards which were focused on topics such as installation, event, and news. Clickable downloadable audio files were downloaded and inserted into Unity and some event triggers allowed the scene to play as intended. Some items like the picnic table and whatever was on it were downloaded from the Unity asset store and a small script was implemented to navigate around the billboards. 

**User Testing**

During a demo day at work, I had several co-workers try out the app. Since I was already working with the technology on campus and people were wondering what we were up to with cameras on tall tripods, it made sense to give them a try and learn more about the museum so they didn't have to ask us what we were doing. The most experienced developers took a glace and said it was neat and went away. Some teammates were surprised that I had made the app from scratch. People who were new to VR seemed more interested than the more experienced people. Avoiding simulator sickness was one of my top priorities for this project. Even though I succeeded with that, my app scared a user when they clicked on my triggered audio sound since I had my volume all the way up. This was totally unexpected and I was pretty sure that taking out the headphones would be better for testing.

__Conclusion__

**What I liked**

The ability to start the project from scratch whereas before, some templates were given as a starter and we had to download them into our Unity scenes. I was able to kill two birds with one stone by learning more about a technology which for one, I need to know more about for my full time job and two, a requirement for this project.

**What I disliked**

Having to troubleshoot a lot of small issues and fix compiler errors in the matter of days. This took time away from actually working on the project and a lot of mentoring and forum searching had to be done in order to complete the project.
