Viconing-

Conducted a user study of a motion capture technology and created a museum gallery where research finding are displayed. The user can navigate around and click on bulletin boards in order to learn more about Vicon.

The GVR Unity SDK version used for this project was 1.0.3.

What I liked
The ability to start the project from scratch whereas before, some templates were given as a starter and we had to download them into our Unity scenes. I was able to kill two birds with one stone by learning more about a technology which for one, I need to know more about for my full time job and two, a requirement for this project.

What I disliked
Having to troubleshoot a lot of small issues and fix compiler errors in the matter of days. This took time away from actually working on the project and a lot of mentoring and forum searching had to be done in order to complete the project.
